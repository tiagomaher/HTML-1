<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<p>We make ourselves a place apart</p>
   <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Behind light words that tease and flout,</p>
<p>But oh, the agitated heart</p>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till someone find us really out.</p>

<p>'Tis pity if the case require</p>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end</p>
<p>We speak the literal to inspire</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of a friend.</p>

<p>But so with all, from babes that play</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar,</p>
<p>So all who hide too well away</p>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.</p>
